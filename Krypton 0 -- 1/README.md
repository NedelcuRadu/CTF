 ## Level Info
>The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!

For this level we can use an [online tool](https://www.base64decode.org/) or simply use the terminal:

```
root@kali:~# base64 -d 
S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ=
KRYPTONISGREAT
```





**Password:** KRYPTONISGREAT
